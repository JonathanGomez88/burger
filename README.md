The burger app works the way the instructions want.  

I have a submit form where the user can type in the name of a burger they would like to eat and click submit.

Upon submit the name of the burger gets saved to the database with a boolean value of devoured = false and gets output to the browser with a "Devour It" button.  

Once the button is pressed the burger gets "devoured" and the boolean value = true and it moves to the devoured section.  

I didn't have time to style the app.  

I apologize, I fell behind and it is already well overdue, but the functionality is all there.
